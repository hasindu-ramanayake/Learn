## INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE ##
**Positions Held**
Staff Engineer at Synopsys (2025-present)
Senior Engineer at Synopsys (2024-2024)
Research and Development Engineer II at Synopsys (2022-2024)
Research and Development Engineer at Synopsys (2019-2021)
Intern at Synopsys Lanka: 20 weeks (2017 – 2018)
------
**Experience working in large complex software products (Synopsys VC Static Low Power) (4+ years).**
VC Static Low Power (VC LP) is a product designed for static low power verification, which is used by large,
top tech/Hardware design companies. 
Learned static low-power, TCL, and UPF from scratch in a short amount of time.
Worked for VC LP to maintain the product, complete enhancements, features, and bugs
Two patent contributions:
https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220075920A1 ( *1 )
https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230072923A1 ( *2 )

**Experience collaborating with individuals from diverse countries: India, China, USA**
**Experience in Machine Learning (ML) / Large Language Model (LLM) projects**
ML project focused on enhancing validation time within the software development life cycle. The ML model
I'm developing recommends benchmarks for specific software changes, enabling the product validation team
to expedite the validation process significantly.
Experimenting with LLVM and GCC to generate call graphs for large complex production-level code bases 
   
**Experience in full-stack web development**
Currently involved in website development for management, focusing on presenting a visual-based analysis
of customer support information from Synopsys tools (JIRA-based ticket data). Additionally, It helps to
perform quality analysis and manage tasks based on this analysis.
Cross-product working experience
Worked with VC LP and VC Formal teams in a collaborative project. The project was for a high-value
customer. In the project we instrumented a power switch model, So VC-Formal can use that model to do
formal verification for a design. The project is considered a novelty, considered as a patent inventor ( *1 )

**Self-driven personal projects that help to improve and utilize customers' computing resources.**
Implemented a data collection command to evaluate design complexity, which serves as a valuable
benchmark for design complexity evaluation. Subsequently, developed a machine learning model to predict
resource allocation for customer designs. This is particularly significant in cloud environments, where
customers pay for resources. The application extends its utility to distributed environments, further
enhancing its practicality and relevance. (*2)

----------------
**Experience in small team project management (fast-paced project).**
Worked with VC LP and VC Formality teams in a collaborative project. The project was for a high-
value customer. As for other responsibilities: collaborate with VC Formality principle engineers, work distribution,
maintain project requests, and be responsible for on-time delivery. 
As a recognition: promotion to R&D II, got ownership of the project

**Daily contributions**
creating speciation, research on requirements and ideas, quality
implementation, and testing 

**Experience in new product prototyping**
Contributed to a new tool/technology for EDA tool debugging to help debug issues in VC LP from
customer sites. The project will improve debuggability on customer sites 
Contribution: Created the data collecting backend, data collection, and design interface APIs to
backend, as well as own backend infrastructure.
