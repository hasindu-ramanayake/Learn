## Experience
### Staff Engineer, Synopsys,  | 2025 - Present
### Senior Engineer, Synopsys,  | 2024 - 2024
### Research and Development Engineer II, Synopsys,  | 2022 - 2024
### Research and Development Engineer, Synopsys,  | 2019 - 2021

### Experience working in large complex software products (Synopsys VC Static Low Power) (4+ years).
*   VC Static Low Power (VC LP) is a product designed for static low power verification, which is used by large, top tech/Hardware design companies.
*   Learned static low-power, TCL, and UPF from scratch in a short amount of time. Worked for VC LP to maintain the product, complete enhancements, features, and bugs.
*   Two patent contributions related to this project.

### Experience collaborating with individuals from diverse countries: India, China, USA
*   Worked with diverse teams on various projects.
*   Communicated ideas and solutions effectively.

### Experience in Large Language Model (LLM)/ Generative AI projects
*   Project on automating functional spec to testplan generations(electric design testcases) using Generative AI(using OpenAI, Langchain, Langgraph)
*   ML project focused on enhancing validation time within the software development life cycle.
*   Developing an ML model that recommends benchmarks for specific software changes, enabling the product validation team to expedite the validation process significantly.
*   Experimenting with LLVM and GCC to generate call graphs for large complex production-level code bases.

### Experience in full-stack web development
*   Involved in website development for management, focusing on presenting a visual-based analysis of customer support information from Synopsys tools (JIRA-based ticket data).
*   It helps to perform quality analysis and manage tasks based on this analysis.

### Cross-product working experience
*   Worked with VC LP and VC Formal teams in a collaborative project for a high-value customer.
*   Instrumented a power switch model for formal verification.
*   Project considered a novelty, resulting in a patent inventor.

### Self-driven personal projects that help to improve and utilize customers' computing resources.
*   Implemented a data collection command to evaluate design complexity, which serves as a valuable benchmark for design complexity evaluation.
*   Developed a machine learning model to predict resource allocation for customer designs, especially in cloud environments.

### Experience in small team project management (fast-paced project).
*   Worked with VC LP and VC Formality teams in a collaborative project for a high-value customer.
*   Responsibilities included: collaborate with VC Formality principle engineers, work distribution, maintain project requests, and be responsible for on-time delivery.
*   Recognition: promotion to R&D II, got ownership of the project.

### Daily contributions
*   Creating speciation, research on requirements and ideas, quality implementation, and testing

### Experience in new product prototyping
*   Contributed to a new tool/technology for EDA tool debugging to help debug issues in VC LP from customer sites.
*   Contribution: Created the data collecting backend, data collection, and design interface APIs to backend, as well as own backend infrastructure.
